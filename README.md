I have developed a shooting game in opengl as my academic project. Here A player can play both in the gun game or arrow game mode. Here the game can be played in sunny weather mode and winter weather mode. Here 5 levels are maintained. Firstly on basic mode if the bullet or arrow has targeted on red then the player will receive 10 points and if the bullet or arrow has targeted on inner white then 9, if blue the 8 and if targeted on outer white then 7 points will be given as described also in the scene.

Then on easy mode, if the bullet or arrow has targeted the score marks as described on the scene a player will get that distinct point.

Then in normal mode, if the bullet or arrow has targeted the balloons as described on the scene a player will get that distinct point.


Then on hard mode, if the bullet or arrow has targeted the score marks as described on the scene a player will get that distinct point.

Finally on extreme mode if the bullet or arrow has targeted on red then the player will receive 10 points and if the bullet or arrow has targeted on inner white then 9, if blue the 8 and if targeted on outer white then 7 points will be given as described also in the scene.

In the gun game mode, the bullets are auto reloaded after firing 5 bullets or middle mouse button to reload, here a player can play in zoom mode or in normal mode in edit mode by pressing X and also move the view by pressing and moving the right button of the mouse. 

Here the bow and the balloons are made with bezier curves. Textures are used on the sky, field, and walls. The rotational target is made with 3d triangles The other objects are made with 3d cubes.
